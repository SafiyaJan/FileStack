The Path class now implements Comparable, and therefore has a new compareTo
method. A replacement file for Path.java is not provided, as it would overwrite
your existing implementation. You must extend this implementation. If you would
like a starting point, you can use this:


public class Path implements Iterable<String>, Comparable<Path>, Serializable
{


...


    /** Compares this path to another.

        <p>
        An ordering upon Path objects is provided to prevent
        deadlocks between applications that need to lock multiple filesystem
        objects simultaneously. By convention, paths that need to be locked
        simultaneously are locked in increasing order.

        <p>
        Because locking a path requires locking every component along the path,
        the order is not arbitrary. For example, suppose the paths were ordered
        first by length, so that /etc precedes
        /bin/cat, which precedes /etc/dfs/conf.txt.

        <p>
        Now, suppose two users are running two applications, such as two
        instances of cp. One needs to work with /etc
        and /bin/cat, and the other with /bin/cat and
        /etc/dfs/conf.txt.

        <p>
        Then, if both applications follow the convention and lock paths in
        increasing order, the following situation can occur: the first
        application locks /etc. The second application locks
        /bin/cat. The first application tries to lock
        /bin/cat also, but gets blocked because the second
        application holds the lock. Now, the second application tries to lock
        /etc/dfs/conf.txt, and also gets blocked, because it would
        need to acquire the lock for /etc to do so. The two
        applications are now deadlocked.

        <p>
        As a general rule to prevent this scenario, the ordering is chosen so
        that objects that are near each other in the path hierarchy are also
        near each other in the ordering. That is, in the above example, there is
        not an object such as /bin/cat between two objects that are
        both under  /etc.

        @param other The other path.
        @return Zero if the two paths are equal, a negative number if this path
                precedes the other path, or a positive number if this path
                follows the other path.
